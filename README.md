# 🚀 Secure Chat Application

Welcome to the **Secure Chat Application**! This project enables users to communicate securely over a network with encrypted messages. Utilizing RSA for secure key exchange and AES for message encryption, your conversations remain private and protected.

## 🌟 Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using AES, ensuring that only the sender and receiver can read them.
- **RSA Key Exchange**: Securely exchange AES keys using RSA encryption.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and simple GUI built with Tkinter for seamless interaction.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages in real-time effortlessly.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language for this application.
- **Sockets**: For network communication.
- **Tkinter**: To create the graphical user interface.
- **Cryptography**: For implementing secure encryption.

## 📋 Requirements

To get started, ensure you have Python 3.x installed, along with the required libraries. You can install the `cryptography` library via pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Server Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Run the server script:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### Client Setup

1. In a separate terminal, run the client script:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

2. Connect to the server by entering the server's IP address and port.

### 📝 Usage

- Type your message in the input field and click "Send" to transmit it.
- Incoming messages will be displayed in the chat box.
- Experience real-time communication with ease!

### ⚠️ Notes

- Ensure that both the server and client are running on the same network, or provide the correct IP address for remote connections.
- You can modify the server IP address in the client script as needed.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

This application is designed for educational purposes. If deploying in a production environment,
consider implementing additional security measures and keeping dependencies updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.
